                            Developer Manuel

Your Developer Manual covers:
        How to install your application and all dependencies
        How to run your application on a server
        How to run any tests you have written for your software
        The API for your server application - all GET, POST, PUT, etc endpoints, and what they each do
        A clear set of expectations around known bugs and a road-map for future development.




                            
May need to install dependencies if the libraries do not import

***before you do any thing***
do "npm install" on the main folder to install all dependencies for backend

Then go to terminal and cd client then do "npm install" to install all dependencies for frontend
then wait a few minutes to finish installing everything


To start both the server and react fronend do "npm run dev" on the main home folder.

go to http://localhost:5500/api


Things that worked well
        worked with a react map gl library to host a proper map and add locations

        Learned to use the bootstrap library to create a good looking fornt end user interface

        Learned to use states in react to create user interactions such as toggle, and navbars

Failures

        Creating a way to have all the map details be one view was a failure, it did not work well

        Tried to hook the contact us page to send the name, email, and message to a email server in the backedn, but it would not build properly

Technology Used:

        React with many react libraries:
                axios - to retrieve data from the backend
                react-map-gl - to host a map and plot points
                Semantic-Ui - to create the navbar and many other ui elements
